        "A fragrance which expertly balances the balsamic sweetness of Benzoin and Vanilla with the dry masculinity of Tobacco and Cognac, Enigma is an enticing experience which transforms any who wear it into a man of mystery and intrigue. An unusual effect occurs where the slightly powdery and Cherry-like tones of Heliotrope mingle with the mouth-watering quality of the Vanilla and Benzoin and appear to fizz, as the boozy splash of Cognac creates a delicious cocktail, which is enjoyed alongside a fine Cuban cigar, as the smoky tones of Tobacco are given a hot spark by the gentle spice notes of Cardamom, Ginger and Pepper.",

This ambery fragrance dresses the skin with vibrant notes as you lose yourself in the energetic pace and mystery of a meandering night in the City of Light.",
