        "The adventurous Silver Mountain Water evokes sparkling streams coursing through the snow-capped Swiss Alps, a bracing landscape in which Olivier Creed, a championship skier, finds relaxation and renewal. A bestseller since its launch, this modern marine/green scent captures the purity of the mountains-soft, milky-sweet blackcurrants mixed with green tea, the richness of bergamot, and sandalwood. Its opaque white bottle hints at icy snowbanks topped with a glistening cap.",

        "A fragrance dedicated to the sensory perfection of Vetiver - an oil obtained from the root of an exotic grass, which perfectly balances earthy, leathery and smoky tones, and as a result is a mainstay of masculine perfumery. Bright Citrus notes mingle with the vibrant green qualities of Galbanum and Celery Seed for a natural freshness, the earthiness of which is strengthened via both Cedar Wood and Needles, alongside a dry bed of Oakmoss. Touches of Pink Pepper, Caraway and Nutmeg swirl around a prominent note of Black Pepper, drawing out a smoky sensuality, whilst hiding in the shadows are the leathery notes of Cistus and Labdanum, which draw out the Vetiverâ€™s inherent leathery assertiveness.",
